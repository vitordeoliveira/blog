# How host a rustlang server for free in the google cloud plataform?

In the Rust language journey, after learning the basics and being able to
create a server, the second thought comes to mind... how do I do it available
for the internet, how should I configure my server for the internet and what is
the cheapest way to do it, if possible for free?

In the end of this blog post you should have your first and free rust server
running on internet.

Here we will answer you that, using the google cloud platform and the cloudrun service.
A little explanation about GCP for the newcomers:

GCP uses the model of account base, and not project base like AWS, so if you
have a gmail account should be very easy to create a GCP account (you might
already have)

Your account on google should be already enough.

Lets create a very simple server in Rust

```bash
cargo new project
cd project/
cargo run
```

That should bring a hello world message.

Now lets create a very simple axum server who simple return a hello world in
the port 8080

for that run

```bash
cargo add axum
cargo add tokio -F full
```

The goal is showing how you post your container in the GCP for free, so I will
not create a fancy server here

In the project/src/main.rs

```rust
use std::env;

use axum::{routing::get, Router};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let host = env::var("SERVER_HOST").unwrap_or("127.0.0.1".to_string());
    let port = env::var("SERVER_PORT").unwrap_or("3000".to_string());

    let app = Router::new().route("/", get(root));
    let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind(format!("{host}:{port}"))
        .await
        .unwrap();
    axum::serve(listener, app).await.unwrap();
}

// basic handler that responds with a static string
async fn root() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, World!"
}
```

That is a very simple example, I will enter in details of how create proper
servers with axum in another blog post, if you have any prior experience with
any other programming language, you are able to understand what we are doing
here.

Then after having our service we need to conteinerize him, we use Docker for do this:

Create a Dockerfile in /project (that is the root, DO NOT DO inside /src folder)

```bash
touch Dockerfile
```

On the file copy and paste this content:

```Dockerfile
FROM rust:slim-buster as build

# create a new empty shell project
WORKDIR /app

# copy over your manifests
COPY ./Cargo.lock ./Cargo.lock
COPY ./Cargo.toml ./Cargo.toml
COPY ./src ./src


RUN cargo build --release

# # our final base
FROM debian:stable-slim
ENV SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
ENV SERVER_PORT=8080
WORKDIR /app

EXPOSE 8080
COPY --from=build /app/target/release/ .
CMD ["./project"]
```

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t project .
docker tag project:latest <yourdockerhubaccount>/project:0.0.1
docker push <yourdockerhubaccount>/project:0.0.1
```

note I add **_--plataform linux/amd64_** the reason is because I am in a
Macbook, by
default mac build for linux/arm64, that wont work in the cloudrun.

now we need to tag and push to some registry, lets use Dockerhub itself,
because google now is able to pull from there

With docker and the server ready in our side, we are ready to publish to cloud run

If is your first time using GCP, he will ask to you to create a new project, if
you already have used, you need to click in your project and create a new one.

![open projects in GCP](/assets/gcp_projects.png)

Lets create a project called "Project"

![create project on GCP](/assets/create_project_in_gcp.png)

After finished click in SELECT PROJECT

![select project on GCP](/assets/select_project_in_gcp.png)

Type Cloud run in the search bar and select the first one:

![select cloudrun service on GCP](/assets/select_cloudrun_service_in_gcp.png)

Then click in create service in the header (check that, we have here a "manage
custom domains", if you want to add a DNS simple click here later)

![create cloudrun service on GCP](/assets/create_cloudrun_service_in_gcp.png)

add your registry in the container image

![container image cloudrun service on GCP](/assets/container_image_cloudrun_service_in_gcp.png)

Scroll down and click in Container(s), Volumes, Networking, Security

There just check if the port is correct, that will be the port that GCP will
proxy from (default is 8080)

![configure container cloudrun service on GCP](/assets/configure_container_cloudrun_service_in_gcp.png)

Then just click in Create and wait the magic happen.

![create cloudrun service on GCP](/assets/create_cloudrun_service.png)

When finish GCP will
generate a DNS to you, and then you can access your server from any internet
connection on the world.

Now if you want to add a custom DNS, just click in
mapping domain, I will not show this part, but if you want to me create another
post showing, please give me a thumbs up, and give me a comment, you can send
me a message in my social networks if you need help.
